# Leave-one-out-SAGA-TPS-tin
QGIS Plugin: validation algorithm of the leave one out method for the interpolation via SAGA thinplatespline (tin)

Plugin for QGIS thath automatically runs the interpolation with the saga module thinplatespline (tin) and at the same time does a leave one out validation for it. As a result one gets the interpolation result and the data of the validation for all the interpolatied data points.

more information regarding the validation method specifically are coming soon. As well as an explanation of what is happening in the code to realise the validation and results.
